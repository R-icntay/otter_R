## **What's in this tutorial?**

In this short tutorial, we'll get to learn and practice some basic functions to help you work easily and intuitively with data. You'll learn how to:

-   Load packages in R

-   Sanity check on our data 

-   Query whether there are missing values 

-   Subset unique rows

-   Keep rows that satisfy your conditions

Let's get started!

## 1. **Meet the Tidyverse and data**

Before we can get started doing some Data Science, we typically begin by loading packages into our current R environment and importing data.

```{r}
# Load the Tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

That's one step down!

```{r}
# Load the library containing the data set
penguins <- read_csv("penguins.csv")

# Print the first few rows of the data
head(penguins)
```

Sometimes, when we have a lot of columns in our data, it may difficult to get a grip of the data at first sight using `slice_head`

`glimpse` produces a transposed version where columns run down the page, and data runs across. This makes it possible to see every column in a data frame. Into the bargain, it also shows the dimension of the data frame.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  glimpse()
```

Before beginning your analysis, it's always a good idea to check whether you have any missing values.

```{r}
# Do we have any missing values?
penguins %>% 
  anyNA()
```

No missing values! Excellent!


```{r}
penguins %>% 
  head()
```

We only see penguins of species `Adelie`. Are there any other species of penguins? To answer this, we use a function/verb in dplyr called `distinct()`. `distinct()` only returns the unique rows in our data:


```{r}
# What are the different species of penguins in our data?
penguins %>% 
  distinct(species)
```

Say we wanted to find the islands where our penguins reside in. We would just modify the above code to include `island` instead of species: 



```{r}
# What are the different islands in our data?
penguins %>% 
  distinct(island)
```

Aha, 3 islands. Now let's go forth and filter!


Now let's go forth and filter!

## 2. filter: keep rows that satisfy your conditions

![](images/dplyr_filter_sm.png){width="500"}

### **Example 1**

Make a subset with only chinstrap penguins.

In the code below, we **filter** the **penguins** data to only keep rows where the entry for **species** exactly matches "Adelie" (case sensitive).

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

Easy, right? We may want to save this to a variable name "adelie_penguins". This is how we would go about it.

```{r}
# Subset data to only obtain Adelie penguins
adelie_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie")

# Print the first few rows of data
adelie_penguins %>% 
  head()
```

Good job!! Give it a try too.

**Question 1: filter** the **penguins** data to only keep rows where the entry for **species** exactly matches "Chinstrap". Save this in a variable name `chinstrap_penguins`

```
BEGIN QUESTION
name: Question 1
manual: false
    
```

```{r}
chinstrap_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")

chinstrap_penguins %>% 
  head()
```




```{r}
. = " # BEGIN TEST CONFIG

success_message: Excellent. You have successfully filtered the data set to only include observations where the species is Chinstrap!

failure_message: Oops! Let's give it another try. Ensure you have filtered the penguins data to only keep rows where the entry for **species** exactly matches **Chinstrap**.
" # END TEST CONFIG

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(testthat)
})


## Test ##
test_that('the subset only has Chinstrap penguins', {
  expect_output(print(unique(chinstrap_penguins$species)), "Chinstrap")
  
})
  
```

### **Example 2**

That went well. What if now we wanted to keep rows where species matches "Chinstrap" **OR** "Gentoo"?

We use the "or" operator, `|` (the vertical line) when we want to filter rows based on multiple observations in a specific column.

```{r}
# Make a subset only containing Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Chinstrap" | species == "Gentoo")
```

Now, let's take this a little bit further. What if we wanted to make subsets based on conditions that span different columns? Say we only want to keep observations (rows) where the species is "Gentoo" **AND** the island is "Dream" - a row should only be retained if both of those conditions are met.

There are a number of ways you can write an **and** statement within `filter()`, including:

-   A comma between conditions indicates both must be met (`filter(x == "a", y == "b")`)

-   An ampersand between conditions indicates both must be met (`filter(x == "a" & y == "b")`)

We can create a subset starting from penguins that only contains observations for Gentoo penguins on Dream Island as follows:

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Gentoo", island == "Dream") %>% 
  head()
```

Give it a try yourself.

**Question 2:** Create a subset from `penguins` containing observations for **female** **Adelie** penguins on **Dream** or **Torgersen** Islands.

```
    BEGIN QUESTION

    name: Question 2

    manual: false

        
```

```{r}
penguins_subset <- penguins %>%
  filter(sex == "female",
         species == "Adelie") %>%
  filter(island == "Dream" | island == "Torgersen")

penguins_subset %>% 
  head()
```




```{r}
. = " # BEGIN TEST CONFIG

success_message: Good job. You have successfully filtered the data set to only include observations where the species is Adelie!

failure_message: Oops! Let's give it another try. Ensure you have filtered the penguins data to only keep rows where the entry for **species** exactly matches **Adelie**.
" # END TEST CONFIG

test_that('the subset only has Adelie penguins', {
  expect_output(print(unique(penguins_subset$species)), "Adelie", fixed = TRUE)
  
})
  
```

```{r}
. = " # BEGIN TEST CONFIG
success_message: You are doing great. The data only has female penguins!

failure_message: Oops! Let's give it another try. Perhaps we included some male penguins?
" # END TEST CONFIG


test_that('the subset only has female penguins', {
  expect_output(print(unique(penguins_subset$sex)), "female", fixed = TRUE)
  
})
```

```{r}
. = " # BEGIN TEST CONFIG

success_message: That's right. You have successfully kept penguins from Torgersen and Dream islands.

failure_message: Almost there. Let's give it another try. Perhaps we included some Biscoe penguins?
" # END TEST CONFIG

test_that('the subset only has penguins from Torgersen and Dream islands', {
  expect_output(glimpse(penguins_subset), "Rows: 51\nColumns: 8", fixed = TRUE)
  
})

```

## So now you know the basics, where next?

Fantastic! You just did some data wrangling in R. You learnt how to:

-   Load packages in R using `library()`

-   Query whether there are missing values `anyNA()`

-   Subset unique rows using `distinct()`

-   Keep rows that satisfy your conditions using `filter()`

The fun doesn't end here, the Tidyverse has a whole bunch of useful verbs for wrangling data:

-   `select()`: keep or exclude some columns

-   `rename()`: rename columns

-   `relocate()`: move columns around

-   `mutate()`: add a new column

-   `group_by()` + `summarize()`: get summary statistics by group

Here are some great places you can learn all about them:
